This is a working version with external function and checking epistemic by several c++ files.

The external cxx function read the initial state from problem.pddl file and parse the problem into a string, and whenever it's get called. it will replace the x,y and direction of the first agent(treated as the moving agent), and call the haskell funciton through that string.

Query:
In this version, query is directly read from the comments in side the pddl file, which means, the depth of the nest knowledge would not be a problem at all.

Domain:
BigBrotherLogic

future improvements:
1. need to finish more testing_problem file
2. need to get the function of operating on reading and output separate from the external c++ file

for now, let's move on to the corridor case to see how it goes.
